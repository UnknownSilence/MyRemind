# MyRemind

Reminder Messaging App made in Javascript for Windows Desktops using the Electron 
Library and the SMS services of the Twilio API, found at: https://www.twilio.com/

================================================================================

This project uses a Trial version of the Twilio API and as such, cannot be used without
a registered API Key, Token, and Phone.

Sign up through the Trilio website and simply change the variables in the index.js file to match your
given authKey, ID, and Phone respectively.

Repackage the app through the dev console with npm run-script build: This will reassemble the application
configured for your account and ready for use.
